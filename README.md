• Developed two evaluation functions alongside Min-Max AB and Alpha Beta Search algorithms, which play the Connect-Four game. The system runs all permutations of the algorithms and evaluation functions.
• Results were analyzed based on constraints such as length of nodes generated and expanded, computation time, memory used and, winning/losing statistics.

Algorithm.cpp has the definitions of MinMax AB and AlphaBeta Search
ConnectFour.cpp is where the game as well as the evaluation functions are defined.
